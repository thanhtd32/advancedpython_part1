#Description:
    #These codes I improved from Exercise 12.
    #1.use 2d array dimension to improve program
    #2.give any postion to user guess (use randomn position)
    #eg: [2, 4, 6, ?], [13, ?, 19, 22], [?, 3, 5, 7, 11],...
    #3.use try..exception to catch user problem input

            [31, 28, 31, 30]
         ]

#it will return True (right) or False (wrong)
