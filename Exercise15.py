#Description:
    #These codes I improved from Exercise 14.
    #1.List all Toiec Score for each Student acquired: Score-Frequency- Frequency rate
    #2.List all Score with range complex for Student acquired: Base Score-Frequency- Frequency rate
    #3.See all the scores with the same max frequency.
    #4.See all the scores with the same min frequency.
    #5.A function to find the average of the TOEIC students acquired.
